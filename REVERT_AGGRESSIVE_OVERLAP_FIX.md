# ‚ö†Ô∏è Reverted: Overly Aggressive Overlap Prevention

## ‚ùå What Went Wrong

I added a "defensive overlap prevention" in `markTimeSlot()` that was TOO STRICT.

**The problem:**
- It was checking for overlaps BEFORE adding slots to occupancy
- If ANY overlap was detected, it rejected the entire slot
- This caused valid schedules (including Year 4!) to be rejected
- Result: Year 4 disappeared, only conflicts appeared

## ‚úÖ What I Did

**Reverted** the defensive checking in `markTimeSlot()` back to the simple, original logic:

```javascript
// REVERTED TO THIS (original):
roomOccupancy[roomKey].push({
    start: schedule.start_time,
    end: schedule.end_time
});

sectionOccupancy[sectionKey].push({
    start: schedule.start_time,
    end: schedule.end_time
});
```

**Instead of this (overly strict):**
```javascript
// OLD CODE (TOO STRICT):
let hasRoomOverlap = false;
for (const existingSlot of roomOccupancy[roomKey]) {
    if (this.timesOverlap(...)) {
        // REJECT THE SLOT!
        hasRoomOverlap = true;
        break;
    }
}

if (!hasRoomOverlap) {
    roomOccupancy[roomKey].push({...});
}
```

## üéØ Why This Was Wrong

**The overlap checking should happen EARLIER**, not at mark time:

1. `findFlexibleSlots()` - Should find non-overlapping slots ‚úì
2. `isSlotAvailable()` - Should check if slot is available ‚úì
3. `markTimeSlot()` - Should just MARK it (not re-check) ‚úì

By the time we reach `markTimeSlot()`, the slot has already been validated. If it's being marked, it SHOULD be valid!

## ‚úÖ Result

After revert:
- Year 4 schedules will appear again ‚úÖ
- The system won't reject valid schedules ‚úÖ
- Overlap detection still works via `isSlotAvailable()` ‚úì

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Generate schedule again**
2. **Year 4 should reappear!**
3. If you still see overlaps in the generated schedule, that's a different issue (data/algorithm level, not prevention level)

## üìù Lesson Learned

**Don't over-engineer prevention** - multiple layers of checking can cause false rejections. Keep checks at the point where decisions are made (slot finding), not at execution time (marking).
