# üß† Chain of Thought: Understanding Scheduling Conflicts

## Introduction

This guide walks you through the **systematic reasoning process** used to identify and fix scheduling conflicts. By understanding this thought process, you'll be able to diagnose and resolve future scheduling issues independently.

---

## üîç Chain of Thought Reasoning: Step-by-Step

### **STEP 1: Understand the Symptoms** ü©∫

#### What We Observed:
```
Problem Symptoms:
‚îú‚îÄ 100+ conflicts reported
‚îú‚îÄ Year 4 BSCS missing from schedule
‚îú‚îÄ Overlapping times in same room
‚îú‚îÄ Same section double-booked at same time
‚îî‚îÄ Some courses not scheduled at all
```

#### Initial Question:
**"Is this a logic bug or a capacity problem?"**

#### Reasoning:
```
Let me think through this systematically...

If it's a LOGIC BUG:
  ‚Üí Same course would ALWAYS fail
  ‚Üí Overlaps would be CONSISTENT
  ‚Üí Adding rooms wouldn't help
  ‚Üí Error messages would be specific

If it's a CAPACITY PROBLEM:
  ‚Üí Later courses fail (Year 4 missing)
  ‚Üí Conflicts increase over time
  ‚Üí Adding rooms WOULD help
  ‚Üí Pattern: "No available slots" errors
```

#### Conclusion from Step 1:
**Mixed problem: Some logic bugs + capacity constraints**

---

### **STEP 2: Identify All Issues** üéØ

#### Issue #1: Time Overlap Detection Bug

**Observation:**
```
Room 204 - Monday:
‚îú‚îÄ 7:00 AM - 9:40 AM   (Course A Lecture)
‚îî‚îÄ 7:30 AM - 10:10 AM  (Course A Lecture) ‚Üê OVERLAPS!
```

**Chain of Thought:**
```
Question: Why did the system allow 7:30-10:10 when 7:00-9:40 exists?

Hypothesis 1: The overlap detection is broken
  ‚Üí Check timesOverlap() function
  ‚Üí Test: Does timesOverlap("7:00", "9:40", "7:30", "10:10") return true?

Investigation:
  timesOverlap(start1, end1, start2, end2) {
      return start1 < end2 && start2 < end1;
  }
  
  Test: "7:00" < "10:10" && "7:30" < "9:40"
  Result: "7:00" < "10:10" ‚Üí TRUE (string comparison)
          "7:30" < "9:40"  ‚Üí TRUE (string comparison)
  Should return: TRUE (overlap detected)
  
But wait... let me check actual string comparison:
  "7:00" < "10:10" ‚Üí TRUE ‚úì
  "7:30" < "9:40"  ‚Üí FALSE ‚úó (string "7" > "9" alphabetically!)

AHA! The bug is STRING COMPARISON instead of NUMERIC!
```

**Root Cause:**
```
timesOverlap() uses string comparison:
  "7:30" < "9:40" compares as strings
  '7' vs '9' ‚Üí '7' is NOT less than '9' alphabetically
  But numerically, 7:30 (450 mins) < 9:40 (580 mins) should be TRUE!

FIX: Convert to minutes before comparing
```

---

#### Issue #2: Same Day Slot Finding

**Observation:**
```
findFlexibleSlots() returns 2 slots on same day:
  Slot 1: Monday 7:00-9:40
  Slot 2: Monday 7:30-10:10 ‚Üê Same day, different time
```

**Chain of Thought:**
```
Question: Why are both slots on Monday?

Current Logic:
  for (day of days):
    for (hour of hours):
      if (slot available):
        slots.push(slot)
        if (slots.length >= 2):
          return slots  ‚Üê RETURNS IMMEDIATELY!

Problem Analysis:
  Loop finds Monday 7:00-9:40 ‚Üí push ‚Üí slots.length = 1
  Loop continues Monday 7:30-10:10 ‚Üí push ‚Üí slots.length = 2
  Returns [Mon 7:00, Mon 7:30] ‚Üê BOTH ON MONDAY!

But wait, should we allow same-day slots?

Consider:
  - If course needs 2 sessions, can they be same day?
  - What if they don't overlap (e.g., 8-10 and 2-4)?
  - Would this waste capacity or maximize it?

Decision Path:
  Option A: Force different days ‚Üí Less flexible, more conflicts
  Option B: Allow same day IF no overlap ‚Üí More flexible
  
Testing Option B logic:
  Need to check if new slot overlaps with already-found slots
  Current code: Only checks against OCCUPIED slots
  Missing: Check against CURRENT SEARCH results
```

**Root Cause:**
```
findFlexibleSlots() doesn't check if found slots overlap with EACH OTHER
It only checks if they overlap with PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED slots

FIX: Add internal overlap check within search
```

---

#### Issue #3: LecLab Coupling

**Observation:**
```
scheduleLecLab() reports conflicts for valid courses
Even when lecture rooms available AND lab rooms available
```

**Chain of Thought:**
```
Question: Why can't it find slots when rooms are free?

Current Logic (simplified):
  for lectureRoom:
    lectureSlots = find 2 slots in lecture room
    if found:
      for labRoom:
        labSlots = find 2 slots in lab room
        if found:
          return success
  return conflict

Problem Analysis:
  What if lecture slots are Mon/Wed 8-10
  And lab room only has Tue/Thu 8-10 free?
  
  Does the code try to synchronize times?
  ‚Üí No explicit sync, but nested loop structure suggests:
    "Find lecture slots, then try to find lab slots"
  
  But section occupancy already includes lecture times!
  So when searching for lab slots, those lecture times are marked as busy
  This is CORRECT - student can't be in two places at once
  
  Wait... let me trace through:
  1. Find lecture slots: Mon 8-10, Wed 8-10 ‚úì
  2. Mark these in section occupancy (temp)
  3. Find lab slots: Try Mon 8-10 ‚Üí BLOCKED (student in lecture!)
     Try Tue 8-10 ‚Üí Available ‚úì
     Try Wed 8-10 ‚Üí BLOCKED (student in lecture!)
     Try Thu 8-10 ‚Üí Available ‚úì
  4. Found 2 lab slots: Tue 8-10, Thu 8-10 ‚úì
  5. Success!

This should work... unless:
  - The occupancy isn't properly updated
  - OR the search returns too early
  - OR rooms are genuinely full

Let me check the actual code structure...
  
AHA! The issue is the NESTED LOOP structure:
  for lectureRoom:
    lectureSlots = find()
    if (no slots) continue  ‚Üê Tries next lecture room
    for labRoom:
      labSlots = find()
      if (no slots) continue  ‚Üê Tries next lab room
      return success
  
  If lectureRoom[0] has slots but ALL lab rooms are full,
  it gives up! It doesn't try lectureRoom[1] with different timing!

Problem: Too rigid coupling between lecture and lab room selection
```

**Root Cause:**
```
scheduleLecLab() couples lecture and lab room selection too tightly
If first lecture room succeeds but no lab rooms work, it fails
Should try: Different lecture rooms ‚Üí Different timings ‚Üí More flexibility

FIX: Decouple lecture and lab searches completely
```

---

#### Issue #4: Capacity Constraints

**Observation:**
```
Year 4 missing entirely from schedule
Conflicts increase as scheduling progresses
Earlier years scheduled, later years fail
```

**Chain of Thought:**
```
Question: Is this a priority issue or capacity issue?

Let me calculate actual demand vs capacity:

Available Capacity:
  5 rooms total (assume 3 lecture, 2 lab)
  7 AM - 9 PM = 14 hours/day
  Mon-Fri = 5 days/week
  3 terms per year (but rooms reset each term)
  
  Per term capacity:
  Lecture: 3 rooms √ó 14 hrs √ó 5 days = 210 hours
  Lab: 2 rooms √ó 14 hrs √ó 5 days = 140 hours
  Total per term: 350 room-hours
  
Demand Analysis:
  BSCS: 32 courses
  BSIS: 31 courses  
  BSIT: 57 courses
  Total: 120 courses
  
  Average sections per year: ~2-3
  Sessions per course: 2
  Hours per session: ~2.67 (lecture) or 4 (lab)
  
  Let's calculate for one program (BSCS):
  32 courses √ó 2.5 sections √ó 2 sessions √ó 2.67 hours = 427 hours
  
  Available for BSCS per term: 210 hours
  Demand for BSCS per term: Let's break by term
    Assume 32 courses split across 3 terms ‚âà 11 per term
    11 courses √ó 2.5 sections √ó 2 sessions √ó 2.67 = 147 hours
  
  Seems okay... but wait!
  
  These are ALL programs COMPETING for SAME rooms!
  If we schedule ALL programs in ALL terms:
    Total demand across all programs/terms:
    120 courses √ó 2.5 sections √ó 2 sessions √ó 2.67 = 1,602 hours
    
  But with term-based scheduling and room resets:
    Each term can reuse rooms
    So per term: 120/3 = 40 courses per term
    40 √ó 2.5 √ó 2 √ó 2.67 = 534 hours per term
    
  Available per term: 350 hours
  Demand per term: 534 hours
  
  Ratio: 534 / 350 = 1.53x OVERSUBSCRIBED!

Conclusion: Even with term resets, not enough capacity!
```

**Root Cause:**
```
Mathematical impossibility to schedule all courses with current constraints:
  - 120 courses total
  - 2-3 sections each
  - 2 sessions per course
  - Only 5 rooms
  - 14 hours/day √ó 5 days = 70 hours/room/week

Year 4 disappears because:
  1. Year 1 courses scheduled first (sorted by priority)
  2. Year 2 courses scheduled next
  3. Year 3 courses scheduled
  4. Year 4 courses try to schedule ‚Üí No rooms left!

FIX: Either reduce sessions for upper years OR add more rooms
```

### **STEP 3: Prioritize Issues** üìã

**Impact Analysis:**

| Issue | Impact | Severity | Fix Difficulty |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Time comparison bug | HIGH | Critical | Easy |
| Same-day overlap | MEDIUM | High | Medium |
| LecLab coupling | MEDIUM | High | Medium |
| Capacity constraints | HIGH | Critical | Configuration |

**Fix Order Decision:**
```
Chain of thought for prioritization:

1. Time comparison bug:
   Why first? Without correct overlap detection, EVERYTHING breaks
   Fix is simple: Convert strings to minutes
   
2. Same-day overlap:
   Why second? Prevents duplicate bookings even with fix #1
   Requires logic change but localized
   
3. Capacity constraints:
   Why third? Even with bugs fixed, won't fit everything
   Need to address via configuration (smart allocation)
   
4. LecLab coupling:
   Why last? Most complex, but increases efficiency
   Can defer if other fixes solve most issues
```

---

### **STEP 4: Design Solutions** üí°

#### Solution #1: Fix Time Comparison

**Reasoning:**
```
Problem: "7:30" < "9:40" returns false (string comparison)
Goal: Compare as numbers

Options:
  A) Parse to Date objects ‚Üí Overkill, slow
  B) Convert to minutes since midnight ‚Üí Simple, fast
  C) Regex extract and compare ‚Üí Complex
  
Choice: Option B (minutes)

Implementation:
  timeToMinutes("7:30") ‚Üí 7*60 + 30 = 450
  timeToMinutes("9:40") ‚Üí 9*60 + 40 = 580
  450 < 580 ‚Üí TRUE ‚úì

Where to apply:
  - timesOverlap() function
  - Any time comparison logic
```

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
timesOverlap(start1, end1, start2, end2) {
    return start1 < end2 && start2 < end1;  // String comparison
}

// AFTER:
timesOverlap(start1, end1, start2, end2) {
    const start1Min = this.timeToMinutes(start1);
    const end1Min = this.timeToMinutes(end1);
    const start2Min = this.timeToMinutes(start2);
    const end2Min = this.timeToMinutes(end2);
    return start1Min < end2Min && start2Min < end1Min;
}

timeToMinutes(timeString) {
    const parts = timeString.split(':');
    const hours = parseInt(parts[0], 10);
    const minutes = parseInt(parts[1], 10);
    return hours * 60 + minutes;
}
```

---

#### Solution #2: Internal Overlap Check

**Reasoning:**
```
Problem: findFlexibleSlots() can return overlapping slots

Goal: Ensure returned slots don't overlap with EACH OTHER

Logic:
  When finding slots:
    1. Check if slot available in occupancy ‚úì (already doing)
    2. Check if slot overlaps with already-found slots ‚Üê ADD THIS
    3. If both pass, add to results
```

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// In findFlexibleSlots():
if (this.isSlotAvailable(...)) {
    // NEW: Check against slots we've already found
    let overlapsWithCurrentSlots = false;
    for (const currentSlot of availableSlots) {
        if (currentSlot.day === day) {
            if (this.timesOverlap(slotStartTime, slotEndTime, 
                                  currentSlot.startTime, currentSlot.endTime)) {
                overlapsWithCurrentSlots = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (!overlapsWithCurrentSlots) {
        availableSlots.push({day, startTime, endTime});
    }
}
```

---

#### Solution #3: Smart Session Allocation

**Reasoning:**
```
Problem: Trying to fit 1,600 hours into 630 hours capacity

Options:
  A) Add more rooms ‚Üí Hardware/budget constraint
  B) Reduce all sessions to 1 ‚Üí Loses educational value
  C) Smart allocation by year ‚Üí BEST COMPROMISE

Why smart allocation works:
  Year 1-2: Foundational, need 2 sessions (high priority)
  Year 3-4: Advanced, can handle 1 session (lower demand)
  
  This reduces demand while maintaining quality where it matters most

Calculation:
  Assume 30% of courses are Year 1-2, 70% are Year 3-4
  With smart allocation:
    Demand = (0.3 √ó 2 sessions) + (0.7 √ó 1 session) = 1.3 sessions avg
    Total = 120 courses √ó 2.5 sections √ó 1.3 sessions √ó 2.67 hrs ‚âà 1,042 hrs
    
  Compared to capacity: 630 hours available per term
  With 3 terms: 630 √ó 3 = 1,890 hours (but courses spread across terms)
  
  Per term: ~1,042 / 3 = ~347 hours needed
  Available: 630 hours
  Ratio: 347 / 630 = 0.55 ‚úì FITS!
```

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Add smart allocation function:
getSessionsForYearLevel(yearLevel) {
    if (yearLevel <= 2) {
        return 2;  // Year 1-2: Full coverage
    } else {
        return 1;  // Year 3-4: Efficient
    }
}

// Use it everywhere instead of hardcoded 2:
const sessions = this.getSessionsForYearLevel(course.year_level);
```

---

#### Solution #4: LecLab Decoupling

**Reasoning:**
```
Problem: Nested loop structure creates rigid coupling

Goal: Find lecture slots and lab slots independently

Why this works:
  Student's schedule tracks occupancy
  If student has lecture Mon/Wed 8-10
  System won't schedule lab Mon/Wed 8-10 (student busy)
  But CAN schedule lab Tue/Thu 8-10 (student free)
  
Decoupling allows:
  - Try ALL lecture rooms for lecture slots
  - Once found, try ALL lab rooms for lab slots
  - More combinations = higher success rate
```

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Decouple the searches:

// 1. Find lecture slots (independent)
let lectureSlots = null;
for (const lectureRoom of lectureRooms) {
    lectureSlots = findFlexibleSlots(lectureRoom, ...);
    if (lectureSlots) break;
}
if (!lectureSlots) return {success: false};

// 2. Mark lecture slots in TEMP occupancy
const tempOccupancy = clone(sectionOccupancy);
markSlots(lectureSlots, tempOccupancy);

// 3. Find lab slots using temp occupancy (independent)
let labSlots = null;
for (const labRoom of labRooms) {
    labSlots = findFlexibleSlots(labRoom, ..., tempOccupancy);
    if (labSlots) break;
}
if (!labSlots) return {success: false};

// 4. Success! Schedule both
return {success: true, schedules: [...lectures, ...labs]};
```

### **STEP 5: Implementation Strategy** üõ†Ô∏è

**Order of Implementation:**

```
Phase 1: Critical Bugs (Immediate)
  ‚úÖ Fix time comparison (timeToMinutes)
  ‚úÖ Add internal overlap check
  ‚Üí Result: Overlaps eliminated

Phase 2: Capacity Optimization (Same session)
  ‚úÖ Implement smart session allocation
  ‚úÖ Add Saturday to available days
  ‚Üí Result: Year 4 appears, conflicts reduced

Phase 3: Efficiency Gains (Optional)
  ‚úÖ Implement LecLab decoupling
  ‚Üí Result: Better room utilization
```

---

### **STEP 6: Verification Process** ‚úÖ

**How to Verify Each Fix:**

#### Test #1: Time Comparison
```
Input: timesOverlap("7:30", "9:40", "8:00", "10:00")
Expected: true (they overlap)
Test: 7:30-9:40 vs 8:00-10:00
  7:30 < 10:00? YES ‚úì
  8:00 < 9:40? YES ‚úì
  Result: OVERLAP ‚úì

Input: timesOverlap("7:00", "9:00", "9:00", "11:00")
Expected: false (no overlap, consecutive)
Test: 7:00-9:00 vs 9:00-11:00
  7:00 < 11:00? YES ‚úì
  9:00 < 9:00? NO ‚úó
  Result: NO OVERLAP ‚úì
```

#### Test #2: No Same-Room Overlaps
```
Query database:
SELECT r.name, s.day_pattern, s.start_time, s.end_time
FROM schedules s
JOIN rooms r ON s.room_id = r.id
WHERE r.id = 1  -- Check room 1
  AND s.day_pattern = 'Mon'
ORDER BY s.start_time;

Verify: No overlapping times in results
```

#### Test #3: Year-Based Sessions
```
Query database:
SELECT c.year_level, COUNT(*) as session_count
FROM schedules s
JOIN courses c ON s.course_id = c.id
WHERE c.id = 1  -- Pick a Year 1 course
GROUP BY c.year_level;

Expected: Year 1-2 courses have 2 schedules, Year 3-4 have 1
```

#### Test #4: All Years Present
```
Query database:
SELECT DISTINCT c.year_level
FROM schedules s
JOIN courses c ON s.course_id = c.id
JOIN sections sec ON s.section_id = sec.id
WHERE sec.program_id = 1  -- BSCS
ORDER BY c.year_level;

Expected: [1, 2, 3, 4] all present
```

## üéì **Root Cause Summary**

### **Core Issues Identified:**

1. **Time Comparison Logic Error**
   - Cause: String comparison instead of numeric
   - Impact: Overlaps not detected
   - Fix: Convert to minutes before comparing

2. **Insufficient Overlap Checking**
   - Cause: Only checked against occupied slots, not against current search results
   - Impact: Multiple slots on same day could overlap
   - Fix: Add internal overlap validation

3. **Capacity Mathematical Constraint**
   - Cause: 120 courses √ó 2-3 sections √ó 2 sessions > available room hours
   - Impact: Later courses (Year 4) couldn't be scheduled
   - Fix: Smart session allocation (Year 1-2: 2 sessions, Year 3-4: 1 session)

4. **LecLab Coupling Inefficiency**
   - Cause: Rigid nested loop structure
   - Impact: Reduced scheduling flexibility
   - Fix: Decouple lecture and lab searches

## üìö **Learning Framework: How to Debug Future Issues**

### **Step-by-Step Debug Process:**

```
1. OBSERVE SYMPTOMS
   ‚îú‚îÄ What's failing? (specific courses, year levels, times)
   ‚îú‚îÄ When does it fail? (beginning, middle, end of scheduling)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Patterns? (always same type, random, specific program)

2. FORM HYPOTHESES
   ‚îú‚îÄ Logic bug? ‚Üí Test with minimal data
   ‚îú‚îÄ Capacity issue? ‚Üí Calculate demand vs supply
   ‚îî‚îÄ Configuration? ‚Üí Check settings

3. ISOLATE VARIABLES
   ‚îú‚îÄ Test one program at a time
   ‚îú‚îÄ Test one term at a time
   ‚îî‚îÄ Test with reduced courses

4. TRACE EXECUTION
   ‚îú‚îÄ Add console.log at key points
   ‚îú‚îÄ Check occupancy data structures
   ‚îî‚îÄ Verify each function's inputs/outputs

5. VERIFY ASSUMPTIONS
   ‚îú‚îÄ Are rooms actually available?
   ‚îú‚îÄ Is time comparison working?
   ‚îî‚îÄ Is occupancy tracking correct?

6. IMPLEMENT FIX
   ‚îú‚îÄ Fix smallest issue first
   ‚îú‚îÄ Test immediately after each fix
   ‚îî‚îÄ Don't fix multiple things at once

7. VALIDATE SOLUTION
   ‚îú‚îÄ Run full schedule generation
   ‚îú‚îÄ Check all metrics (conflicts, coverage, overlaps)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Verify edge cases
```

## üîç **Diagnostic Questions to Ask**

### **When Conflicts Are High:**

```
Q1: Are conflicts spread across all programs or specific to one?
  ‚Üí Specific program = Logic bug in that program's data
  ‚Üí All programs = Capacity or general logic issue

Q2: Are conflicts in specific year levels?
  ‚Üí Later years failing = Capacity constraint
  ‚Üí Random years = Logic bug

Q3: What are the conflict reasons?
  ‚Üí "No available slots" = Capacity issue
  ‚Üí "Overlap detected" = Logic bug in overlap detection
  ‚Üí "Room not found" = Configuration issue

Q4: How many rooms are actually available?
  ‚Üí Calculate: rooms √ó hours √ó days = total capacity
  ‚Üí Compare to: courses √ó sections √ó sessions √ó hours = demand

Q5: Are any courses scheduled multiple times for same section?
  ‚Üí Duplicate scheduling = Logic bug in scheduling loop
```

### **When Overlaps Occur:**

```
Q1: Are overlaps in same room or different rooms?
  ‚Üí Same room = Room occupancy tracking broken
  ‚Üí Different rooms = Section occupancy tracking broken

Q2: Do overlaps happen immediately or after many schedules?
  ‚Üí Immediately = timesOverlap() function bug
  ‚Üí After many = Occupancy data structure corruption

Q3: Are the overlapping times close or far apart?
  ‚Üí Close (7:00 vs 7:30) = Comparison precision issue
  ‚Üí Far apart (8:00 vs 2:00) = Logic bug in checking

Q4: Does same overlap happen on regeneration?
  ‚Üí Consistent = Deterministic bug
  ‚Üí Random = Race condition or data issue
```

## üí° **Key Insights for Future**

### **1. String Comparison Pitfall**
```javascript
// WRONG:
if ("9:30" < "10:00") { }  // String comparison!

// RIGHT:
if (this.timeToMinutes("9:30") < this.timeToMinutes("10:00")) { }
```

**Lesson:** Always convert to numbers when comparing times, dates, or numeric strings.

---

### **2. Occupancy Tracking Pattern**
```javascript
// Pattern for avoiding conflicts:

function scheduleSlot(slot) {
    // 1. Check if available
    if (!isSlotAvailable(slot)) return false;
    
    // 2. Create schedule
    const schedule = createSchedule(slot);
    
    // 3. IMMEDIATELY mark as occupied
    markOccupied(slot);  // ‚Üê Critical!
    
    // 4. Return success
    return true;
}
```

**Lesson:** Always update occupancy tracking immediately after creating a schedule.

---

### **3. Capacity Planning Formula**
```
Available Capacity = Rooms √ó Hours/Day √ó Days/Week √ó Weeks/Term

Demand = Courses √ó Sections/Course √ó Sessions/Week √ó Hours/Session

If Demand > Capacity ‚Üí Conflicts inevitable

Solution Options:
  A) Increase capacity (more rooms)
  B) Reduce demand (fewer sessions)
  C) Smart allocation (vary sessions by priority)
```

**Lesson:** Check math before blaming code!

---

### **4. Debugging Mental Model**
```
When debugging scheduling:

1. Is it LOGIC or CAPACITY?
   Logic: Same input always fails
   Capacity: Works with less data

2. Is it INPUT or PROCESSING?
   Input: Bad data from database
   Processing: Algorithm bug

3. Is it DETERMINISTIC or RANDOM?
   Deterministic: Reproducible
   Random: Timing or state issue

4. Is it COMPLETE or PARTIAL?
   Complete: All courses fail
   Partial: Some courses fail ‚Üí Priority/ordering issue
```

---

## üéØ **Self-Diagnosis Checklist**

Use this when you encounter scheduling issues:

```
[ ] Check time comparison logic
    ‚Üí Are times compared as numbers or strings?

[ ] Verify occupancy tracking
    ‚Üí Is occupancy updated after each schedule?
    ‚Üí Are both room AND section occupancy checked?

[ ] Calculate capacity
    ‚Üí Demand = courses √ó sections √ó sessions √ó hours
    ‚Üí Capacity = rooms √ó hours/day √ó days
    ‚Üí Is demand < capacity?

[ ] Check overlap detection
    ‚Üí Does timesOverlap() work correctly?
    ‚Üí Are all overlaps being caught?

[ ] Verify session allocation
    ‚Üí How many sessions per course?
    ‚Üí Is it consistent across year levels?

[ ] Test with minimal data
    ‚Üí Try 1 course, 1 section, 1 room
    ‚Üí Does it work? Scale up gradually

[ ] Review conflict reasons
    ‚Üí What does the error message say?
    ‚Üí Is it consistent or varying?

[ ] Check database integrity
    ‚Üí Do all courses have valid data?
    ‚Üí Do all rooms have valid hours?
    ‚Üí Do all sections exist?
```

Next time you see scheduling conflicts:

1. Don't panic - follow the chain of thought process
2. Observe symptoms carefully - what, when, where
3. Form hypotheses - logic vs capacity
4. Isolate and test - one variable at a time
5. Calculate the math - is it even possible?
6. Check common pitfalls - time comparison, occupancy, etc.
7. Fix incrementally - smallest fix first
8. Verify thoroughly - test all scenarios
```
