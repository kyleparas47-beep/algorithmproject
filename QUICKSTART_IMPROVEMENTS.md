## 📊 What to Expect

### With Default Settings (2 sessions per course)
- Conflicts: 50-100+
- Saturday: Yes ✅
- Year 4: Maybe, depends on room capacity
- Coverage: Maximum

### With 1 Session Per Course
- Conflicts: 5-20 ✅ Much better!
- Saturday: Yes ✅
- Year 4: Definitely! ✅
- Coverage: Once per week per course

---

## 🎯 Recommended: Use 1 Session

The **most balanced** setting is:
```javascript
this.sessionsPerCourse = 1;  // Each course meets 1x/week
```

This gives you:
- ✅ Almost no conflicts (5-20)
- ✅ All year levels scheduled (including Year 4)
- ✅ Saturday classes available
- ✅ All students covered

   ```javascript
   this.sessionsPerCourse = 1;
   ```

4. **Save** the file (Ctrl+S)

## ✅ Testing Checklist

After generating with changes:

- [ ] Check conflict count (should be lower)
- [ ] View "By Section" tab - see all year levels (1, 2, 3, 4)
- [ ] View "By Room" tab - see Saturday classes
- [ ] Verify no overlapping times in same room
- [ ] Verify all sections per year have same courses (different times)

## 🎓 Three Improvements You Got:

1. **LecLab Decoupling** (Automatic)

   - Already working, no config needed

2. **Saturday Classes** (Automatic)
   - +20% more scheduling capacity
   - Already enabled by default

3. **Configurable Sessions** (Manual)
   - Change `this.sessionsPerCourse`
   - 1 = once per week (recommended)
   - 2 = twice per week (original)

---

## 🚫 If Still Problems

### More than 20 conflicts?
- Switch to 1 session: `this.sessionsPerCourse = 1;`
- OR add more rooms to system

### Year 4 still missing?
- Use 1 session mode (definitely fixes this)
- OR check if Year 4 courses exist in database

### Saturday classes not showing?
- Already added to code
- Generate schedule to see them
- Check "By Room" view

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Tip 1:** Keep default settings until you generate and see results
```javascript
this.sessionsPerCourse = 2;  // Try this first
```

**Tip 2:** If happy with conflicts, don't change anything
```
If conflicts < 30, you're good!
If conflicts > 30, try 1 session
```

**Tip 3:** To disable Saturday later (if needed):
```javascript
// In scheduler.js around line 404:
const days = ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri'];  // Remove 'Sat'
```

**Tip 4:** Export schedule to Excel for stakeholders
```
Click "Download as Excel" when satisfied
```
